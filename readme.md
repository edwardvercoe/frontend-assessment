## Edward Vercoe - MindArc front-end assessment submission

Thank you for the oportunity to complete the frontend technical assessment. It was a lot of fun to work through and create these exercises.

I decided to go with the following tech stack: React, NextJS and SASS along with framer-motion for the animation library.

## Set up and viewing the assessment

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Thank you

One last thank you for the oportunity! Excited for any feedback available.
