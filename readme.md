## Edward Vercoe - MindArc front-end assessment submission

Thank you for the oportunity to complete the frontend technical assessment. It was a lot of fun to work through and create these exercises.

I decided to go with the following tech stack: React, NextJS and SASS along with framer-motion for the animation library.

## Set up and viewing the assessment

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Once localhost is open you will be able to access both exercises with the following links:

Exercise 1: [http://localhost:3000/exercise-1](http://localhost:3000/exercise-1)
Exercise 2: [http://localhost:3000/exercise-2](http://localhost:3000/exercise-2)

Alternatively you can view a deployed live version of the assessment here:
